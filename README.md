This single page application shows a map of a few places we visited in San Francisco on a recent vacation. It was built for a Neighborhood map project for the Front End Web Developer Nanodegree at Udacity.

## Getting Started
No installation necessary. Follow this [link](https://curlygirl11.github.io/neighborhood-maps/). 

OR you can *[clone](https://github.com/curlygirl11/Neighborhood-Map.git)* or *[download](https://github.com/curlygirl11/Neighborhood-Map.git)* this project via [GitHub](https://github.com) to your local machine.

## How to use the App 
Click on the colored markers for additional information on the site provided by Foursquare. I did not include any of the places that we visited that did not have foursquare data available. 

The app allows you to filter the list down as you type. In return, it displays the locations on the map.

Thank you to all of the wonderful students with Github Repositories that I could reference when I was stuck.
